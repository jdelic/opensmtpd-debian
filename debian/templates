Template: opensmtpd/mailname
Type: string
Default:
_Description: System mail name:
 The "mail name" is used as the domain name in the email address for
 messages that only have a "local part" (such as <jrandomuser> or
 <root>). It should be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that you are
 entitled to use.
 .
 For instance, to allow the local host to generate mail with addresses
 such as <jrandomuser@example.org>, set the system mail name to
 "example.org".
 .
 This mail name is used as the hostname in the SMTP greeting banner, and
 will also be used by other programs.

Template: opensmtpd/root_address
Type: string
Default:
_Description: Root and postmaster mail recipient:
 Mail for the "postmaster", "root", and other system accounts should be
 redirected to the user account(s) of the actual system administrator(s).
 .
 Please enter a comma-separated list of the usernames of the intended
 recipients. Leave this field blank to not create an alias for "root";
 in this case, the root account will receive mail addressed to
 "postmaster" and other system accounts, assuming aliases for these
 accounts do not already exist.
