opensmtpd for Debian
--------------------

This package does not install upstream's "mailq" link to "smtpctl" since this
link is only provided for mailwrapper(8) compatibility (Debian doesn't use
mailwrapper) and the preferred invocation is via "smtpctl show queue". System
administrators insisting on having a "mailq" command may instead create a shell
alias.
